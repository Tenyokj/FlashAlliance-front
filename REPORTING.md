# Community Testing and Issue Reporting

FlashAlliance frontend is currently in demo/community testing mode.

## Important Notice
This is **not** a cash bug bounty by default.
Confirmed reports and helpful fixes can be rewarded in `FATK` for use in the FlashAlliance ecosystem.

## What to Include in a Report
1. Short title and summary.
2. Environment: network, wallet, browser, route.
3. Steps to reproduce.
4. Expected result vs actual result.
5. Logs/errors/screenshots (if available).
6. Suggested fix (optional, but preferred).

## Where to Report
1. Email: `av7794257@gmail.com`
2. GitHub Issue (for non-sensitive bugs): create issue in frontend repo.
3. Pull Request: include reproduction and fix notes.

## Severity Guidance
1. Critical: can lead to user fund loss, unauthorized transactions, or signature abuse.
2. High: broken transaction paths, misleading on-chain action prompts.
3. Medium: wrong state/amount display that can cause user mistakes.
4. Low: visual bugs and non-critical UX issues.

## Reward Guidelines (Indicative)
1. Critical: up to 100,000 FATK
2. High: up to 30,000 FATK
3. Medium: up to 10,000 FATK
4. Low: recognition / smaller FATK grants

Final reward amount is decided by maintainers based on impact, reproducibility, and fix quality.
