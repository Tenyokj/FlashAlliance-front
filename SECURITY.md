# Security Policy

## Scope
This repository contains the FlashAlliance frontend (Next.js dApp and landing pages).

In-scope examples:
1. Wallet connection vulnerabilities in frontend transaction flow.
2. Incorrect contract interaction that can mislead users or trigger unsafe actions.
3. Sensitive information exposure in client code or build output.
4. Auth/session or admin-panel issues (if introduced in this repo).

Out-of-scope examples:
1. Issues in third-party services not controlled by this repo.
2. Pure UI/typo/content issues without security impact.
3. Known chain-level behavior (mempool ordering, network congestion, etc.).

## Reporting
Please report security issues privately first:
1. Email: `av7794257@gmail.com`
2. Subject: `FlashAlliance Security Report`
3. Include reproduction steps, affected route/file, and impact.

Do not publish a proof-of-concept publicly before the issue is acknowledged and fixed.

## Response Targets
1. Initial acknowledgment: within 72 hours.
2. Triage decision: within 7 days.
3. Fix timeline: depends on severity and release schedule.

## Rewards
This project currently runs a community testing program.
Rewards are paid in `FATK` and are not a cash bounty unless explicitly announced.
